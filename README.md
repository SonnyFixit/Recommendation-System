## General Info

This project implements a Recommendation System to suggest jokes to users and it is based on data from: https://eigentaste.berkeley.edu/dataset/ <br>
The system is designed to analyze user preferences and provide personalized joke recommendations. <br>
It incorporates methods for data preprocessing, user similarity calculations, and collaborative filtering techniques. <br>

## Key Programming Practices

* **Modularity:** Code is structured into functions and modules for ease of maintenance and scalability.
* **Efficiency:** Optimized algorithms are used for fast processing of user ratings and joke datasets.
* **Readability:** Consistent naming conventions and structured coding practices for enhanced clarity.
* **Error Handling:** Robust error handling to ensure stable performance across diverse datasets.
* **Documentation:** Comprehensive documentation explaining the purpose and functionality of each component.

## Technologies

* Python 3.11.3
* Visual Studio Code
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Sqlite

## Features

* Processing and normalization of user ratings from the Jester dataset.
* User-based collaborative filtering for personalized joke suggestions.
* Calculation of similarity scores using cosine similarity and other metrics.
* Ability to recommend a set of top-rated jokes to individual users.
* Evaluation of recommendation accuracy and system performance.

## How to Run

* Ensure Python 3.x and necessary libraries (`numpy`, `pandas`) are installed.
* Clone the repository to your local environment.
* Load the Jester dataset.
* Run scripts to process the data and generate joke recommendations.
